# Chief commander log

Append-only. Format: `[ISO timestamp] TYPE: message` (see `messages/README.md`).

Commander uses these types:
- `WAKEUP` — start of a wake cycle
- `READ` — read terminal logs (summary of what's new)
- `REPLY` — reply to a Q-ASSUMED or Q-BLOCKED (reference question's timestamp)
- `PLAN` — a planning decision (next round, priority shift)
- `SLEEP` — scheduling next wakeup with delay + reason

[2026-05-03T23:47:32Z] WAKEUP: cycle 1 — pre-launch. T1/T2/T3 logs empty. Ed about to paste prompts into 3 fresh Claude auto-mode terminals. Nothing to process this cycle.
[2026-05-03T23:47:32Z] SLEEP: 1500s (25 min). Mid-cadence to catch first STARTED entries when terminals come online.

[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] WAKEUP: cycle 2 — manual (loop died after cycle 1; resumed by Ed for handoff to web). T1 + T2 + T3 have been working autonomously in parallel. Commits since cycle 1: T1 bootstrap + server modules (commit 19f0613), T2 server domain (commit 1321fb5). T3 STARTED with package scaffold + types (uncommitted in working tree). Open Q-ASSUMED items: 4 — addressed via per-terminal from-orchestrator.md replies in this cycle.
[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] PLAN: Round 1 in progress. T1 ~50% (bootstrap done, server modules done; auth + middleware + chrome + pages remaining). T2 ~70% (server domain landed; API + admin pages + manifest remaining). T3 ~15% (package + types scaffolded; editor + blocks + portal-variants port remaining). One real cross-team issue: T2's `PortalVariantPort.role` is typed as user-Role, should be `PortalRole`. Correction sent to T2 inbox; T3 already shipping the right type.
[2026-05-04T07:00:00Z] SLEEP: deferred — Ed switching to Claude web. Commander loop is offline until Ed re-engages it from a Mac terminal OR converts it to a cloud `/schedule` agent.

[2026-05-04T08:00:00Z] WAKEUP: cycle 3 — manual. Ed reopened terminals; T1 + T2 both DONE Round 1. Round 2 prompts drafted: T1-round2-wire-and-demo (foundation port adapters + catch-all routes + demo seed) and T2-round2-ecommerce (port ecommerce plugin from 02). TASK entries dropped into both inboxes. T3 still mid-Round-1 (last entry 01:11Z, ~7h ago — likely sleeping or terminated; Ed needs to re-paste T3 prompt).
[2026-05-04T08:00:00Z] PLAN: Round 2 split. T1: wire fulfillment into shell, full smoke test, demo seed. T2: port ecommerce plugin standalone. T3: continue Round 1 (port editor + 58 blocks + portal-variants).
[2026-05-04T08:00:00Z] SLEEP: deferred — commander still offline pending cloud-schedule decision.

[2026-05-04T18:00:00Z] WAKEUP: cycle 4 — manual. Ed back from work. State check: ALL THREE TERMINALS shipped Round 1 + Round 2; T1 ALSO shipped Round 3 (multi-plugin wire-up with real portalVariantAdapter, smoke green: 14 pages 200 + multi-plugin API dispatch). 315 source files across portal + 3 plugins. T1's loop ended after R3 DONE; T2 and T3 loops ended after their respective DONE entries.
[2026-05-04T18:00:00Z] PLAN: Round 4 prompts drafted. T1 R4: Milesy Media demo button + POV toggle + sign-in wiring (`T1-round4-demo-button.md`). T2 R3: end-to-end phase-preset smoke test + agency-HR plugin (`T2-round3-validation.md`). T3 R2: lift real block + admin UIs from `02` (`T3-round2-block-uis.md`, the heaviest task — likely needs multiple loop cycles). TASK entries dropped in all three inboxes. Ed re-pastes prompts to restart loops.
[2026-05-04T18:00:00Z] SLEEP: deferred — Ed manually orchestrating from this terminal session.

[2026-05-04T20:35:00Z] WAKEUP: cycle 5 — autonomous loop online (orchestrator-init paste). T1 R4 picked up: STARTED 20:14, Q-ASSUMED 20:25 (demo route placement deviation), COMMIT 6c937a9 at 20:30 (Goal A + D — static site Sign in + Demo CTA + last-deployed footer). T2 + T3 outboxes silent since their R2/R1 DONE entries — Round 4 prompts in their inboxes still await re-paste from Ed.
[2026-05-04T20:35:00Z] REPLY: approved T1's demo route deviation (`/demo` top-level, not `/portal/demo`) — sound reasoning, matches architecture §11. Reply written to `terminal-1/from-orchestrator.md`.
[2026-05-04T20:35:00Z] PLAN: Cycle 5 actions — single REPLY to T1 (above), no other corrective work needed. T1 progressing on Goals B + C; will likely DONE within next 1-2 wakes. T2 + T3 still need Ed to paste their Round 4 prompts (T2-round3-validation.md, T3-round2-block-uis.md) — leaving inboxes ready, no nudge to log. Cadence: 1500s — T1 active progress + commits since cycle 4.
[2026-05-04T20:36:00Z] SLEEP: 1500s (25 min). Active progress on T1 R4 — commit 6c937a9 lands Goal A+D, Goals B+C in flight. T2/T3 still parked awaiting Ed's re-paste; will surface in cadence regardless.

[2026-05-04T20:42:00Z] PLAN: mid-cycle pre-draft (Ed asked for useful work in the meantime). Audited T2-round3-validation.md + T3-round2-block-uis.md — both solid, no rework. Drafted T1 R5 at `terminal-prompts/T1-round5-end-customer.md` and listed under "Queued" in `terminal-prompts/README.md`. Closes the third-tier (Agency → Client → End-customer) recursion: per-client signup + login (`/api/auth/end-customer/signup`, embed-login bridge), real `/portal/customer` powered by T3's `getActivePortalVariant` for the `account` PortalRole, third POV in the demo cycle (agency → client → customer), seed-demo extended with a demo end-customer. NOT to drop into T1 inbox until R4 DONE.

[2026-05-04T20:48:00Z] UPDATE: T2 + T3 restarted while I was pre-drafting. State revision (cycle 5 SLEEP at 20:36 was wrong about them being parked):
- T3 R2 Phase A DONE (58 blocks lifted from `02`, BlockRenderer + pageTemplates rewritten, smoke 31/31 pass, tsc clean). Their staged work was absorbed into commander commit e702415 — same shared-`.git/index` pattern that happened in cycle 2 (`96cb64f`). T3 acknowledged it in their outbox at 19:33:00Z and continued straight into Phase B (visual editor admin page lift). One Q-ASSUMED noted: T3 stubbed `ecommerceBridge.tsx` (useCart/ProductVariantPicker shims) because T2's ecommerce client surface isn't exposed yet; T2 swaps when ready.
- T2 R3 Goal A DONE @ commit `3335bf9` — phase lifecycle smoke (in-process 9/9 + HTTP ~50/0 fail), chapter `04-phase-lifecycle-smoke.md` written, MASTER row #26. STARTED Goal B (`@aqua/plugin-agency-hr`) at 20:26:00Z.
- T2 flagged 2 cross-team items in their PROGRESS log (no Q-BLOCKED, no immediate action):
  - Bug B: variant ids in T1's seeded phase defaults (`starter-discovery`, etc.) don't exist in T3's editor — `phase.variant_apply_failed` activity events show alongside `phase.advanced`. Soft-fail per arch §7, transition still completes. Track for next cross-team round.
  - Install-link refresh tip: pure source edits in workspace-dep plugins don't bump the install graph; `rm -rf node_modules/@aqua/plugin-X && npm install` workaround. Surface to T1 for `.npmrc` comment block in their next round prompt.
- No Q-BLOCKED outstanding. No new REPLY needed; T3 already ack'd absorption pattern, T2's bugs are tracked.
